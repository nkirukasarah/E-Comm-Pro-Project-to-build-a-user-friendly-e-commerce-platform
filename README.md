## E-Comm Pro Project

## Project Overview:
E-Comm Pro is a scalable, secure, and user-friendly e-commerce platform designed to help small businesses establish and maintain an online presence. It offers essential features like product listing, inventory management, user accounts, payment processing, and analytics dashboards to expand market reach and drive growth.

## Key Phases & Timeline:

## Planning & Requirement Gathering: 2 weeks
## UI/UX Design: 3 weeks
## Frontend & Backend Development: 9 weeks
## Integration & API Development: 3 weeks
## Testing & Deployment: 5 weeks
## Risk Management:

User Acceptance Delays: Addressed by early stakeholder engagement and clear review deadlines.
Resource Constraints: Managed through optimized task allocation and project management tools (Trello, Jira, Gantt Charts).
Change Request Impact:
Additional features (e.g., multi-currency support) may extend the timeline by 3 weeks. Possible mitigations include resource reallocation, feature postponement, or deprioritization of non-critical tasks.

## Recommendations:
If the project exceeds the 16-week timeline, options include postponing non-essential features, hiring additional developers, or negotiating timeline extensions while ensuring core functionalities are delivered on time.
